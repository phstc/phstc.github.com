We use [Sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq) to process messages from images conversion to shipping tickets' generation.

The total size of our queues decreases and increases drastically during the day. When it happens we have to increase or decrease our workers by adding or removing new EC2 instances.

## Amazon Auto Scale

I will not get into the details of [Amazon Auto Scaling](http://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/), as it deserves an entire post about it.

Roughly you have to create an Auto Scaling Group, Launch Configuration and Scaling Up/Down policies.

Remember that Amazon Auto Scaling will not remove your instances automatically. If you create Scaling Up policies, you will need to create Scaling Down as well to remove them.

### Netflix Asgard

Instead of creating your own Auto Scale scripts with [AWS-SDK](http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/), I recommend [Netflix Asgard](https://github.com/Netflix/asgard). It isn't a killer tool, but it works.

#### Asgard considerations

It doesn't work well with other Tomcat apps. To work properly on Tomcat, it must be the ROOT app. Another option is to run it as a [standalone app](https://github.com/Netflix/asgard/wiki/Quick-Start-Guide), this is how I use it.

    JAVA_HOME=/System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Home java -Xmx1024M -XX:MaxPermSize=128m -jar asgard-standalone.jar "" localhost 8888

(it works better on Java 6)

## Queue Size Metric

To trigger your Scale Up/Down policies based on the Queue Size, you have to publish a new [Custom Metric on CloudWatch](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/publishingMetrics.html).

### Get the Queue Size

    require "sidekiq"
    class SidekiqMetric
      def queue_size
        stats = Sidekiq::Stats.new
        stats.queues.values.inject 0, :+
      end
    end

### Publish the Queue Size

    require "aws-sdk"
    class QueueSizeMetric
      def initialize
        AWS.config access_key_id: "…", secret_access_key: "…" 
      end
  
      def put
        metric = AWS::CloudWatch::Metric.new "Worker", "QueueSize"
        size   = SidekiqMetric.new.queue_size
        metric.put_data [{value: size}]
      end
    end

That's it… When you create your Scale Policies, you just have to set up the metric namespace to "Worker" and name to "QueueSize".

## Update the metric

We use the [whenever gem](https://github.com/javan/whenever) to create a cron job to update the queue size every minute.

    # schedule.rb
    every 1.minutes do
      command "cd /home/ubuntu/queues/current && bundle exec rake update_queue_size_metric"
    end

    # RakeFile
    task :update_queue_size_metric do
      QueueSizeMetric.new.put
    end
    
Another options is to use a worker to update the metrics. 

    # app/workers/queue_size_metric_worker.rb
    class QueueSizeMetricWorker
      include Sidekiq::Worker
      
      def perform
        QueueSizeMetric.new.put
        QueueSizeMetricWorker.perform_in 1.minute 
      end
    end
