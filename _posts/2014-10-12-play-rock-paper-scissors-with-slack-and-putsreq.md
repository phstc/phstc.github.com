title: Play Rock-paper-scissors with Slack and PutsReq
---

Inspired by [Say Hello World to Wombat using PutsReq
](https://wombat.co/blog/say-hello-world-to-wombat-using-putsreq), this post will give you an introduction on [Slack Outgoing webhooks](https://my.slack.com/services/new/outgoing-webhook). 

Outgoing webhooks allows you to get data in and out of Slack in real time when someone send a message in a specific channel or with a trigger word.

First, letâ€™s fork the Rock-paper-scissors webhook on PutsReq.
