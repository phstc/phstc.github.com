This post is based on this thread "[Adding images to iPhone Simulator](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/468879/adding-images-to-iphone-simulator/)" on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/).

The [easiest answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/468879/adding-images-to-iphone-simulator/2039856#2039856) which worked for me to add pictures in the Simulator Photo Gallery was:
<!--more-->

    1. Drag it to simulator, then Safari opens (or browse to the Image in the internet using Safari);
    2. Click and hold on the image;
    3. When the pop-up appears, choose Save Image and enjoy. ;)

Answer by [Thanh-Cong Vo](http://stackoverflow.com/users/192800/thanh-cong-vo).

The answers suggesting to save the images in "~/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/...", didn't work for me.

I created this post specially because I needed to do these steps again, but I forgot how to do it, then I needed to find it again. :(
