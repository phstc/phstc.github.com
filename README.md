## Notes to self

For creating new draft:

```shell
rake draft:new
What's the name for your next post?
```

All options:

```shell
rake -T

rake draft:new    # Creating a new draft for post/entry
rake draft:ready  # Copy draft to production post
rake server       # Start jekyll in development mode
```
